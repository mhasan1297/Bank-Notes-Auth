# Bank-Notes-Auth

The objective is to analyse the given data sets 
V1 and V2 from the bank_authentication_notes.csv 
which is taken from openML datasets, is to identify the 
forged and real notes using K-Means Clustering Concept 
forming two distinct clusters of real and forged notes. KMeans is easy and simple uses unsupervised learning to 
solve clustering related problems. It classifies the given 
datasets to form a group of clusters based on some 
similarities. The major goal is defining k centers, one for 
each cluster. The ultimate aim is to use this dataset to 
train a machine to detect fake notes automatically. 
However, before implementation, it is important to 
access if this dataset can sufficiently distinguish forged 
banknotes from genuine ones. Hence, in this report, with 
k-mean cluster analysis, unsupervised machine learning, 
performed on the datasets, we will visualise and outline 
the results and make according to recommendations.
